Claim 2 (RQ2): D2CFG / Call-Graph Accuracy

Step1: run demo
Execution:
Linux/macOS
cd /path/to/AndroByte
chmod +x claims/claim2/run.sh
./claims/claim2/run.sh


windows (powershell)
cd \path\to\AndroByte
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
.\claims\claim2\run.ps1

step2: After the run, confirm the call-graph Dynamic Dataflow-Aware Call Graph (D2CFG) generated by AndroByte exists at:
outputs/ap-news/output/visited_graph.png

Paper Mapping:

Results correspond to Section 5.2.2 (RQ2 â€” D2CFG Accuracy), Table 4.

For artifact comparison, we provide the visual output (visited_graph.png) for the demo app.

In the full evaluation (Table 4), precision/recall/F1 were computed by matching generated edges against reference edges using Androguard.

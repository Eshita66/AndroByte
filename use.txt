Intended Use:
This artifact accompanies the paper
“AndroByte: LLM-Driven Privacy Analysis through Bytecode Summarization and Dynamic Dataflow Call Graph Generation”
(ACSAC 2025).

It is intended for academic research and artifact evaluation of privacy analysis in Android applications.
The scripts allow evaluators to reproduce the main claims of the paper:
- RQ1: Leak Detection Accuracy
- RQ2: Call-Graph Accuracy (D2CFG)
- RQ3: Explainability (G-Eval)

Limitations:
- This artifact is not designed for production use or commercial deployment.
- The analysis is limited to the provided benchmark datasets (DroidBench, UBCBench) and the real APKs.
- The output summary language may vary slightly across runs when using different LLM models.
